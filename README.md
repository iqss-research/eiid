### Code Version 0.1.2

This repo includes the R package for replicating the results in:

Wenxin Jiang, Gary King, Allen Schmaltz, and Martin A. Tanner. Forthcoming. “Ecological Regression with Partial Identification.” Political Analysis.

A step-by-step guide for reproducing the results in the paper is available in the associated Dataverse archive at https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/W7KZVL

The Dataverse archive also includes all of the data analyzed in the paper.

For convenience, this repo only includes the standalone R package (eiPartialID) in the folder 'package' (which is similar to that in the Dataverse archive, with some minor differences to conform to CRAN policies). The package should be installed locally from source. An overview of usage is provided in the following HTML vignette, which can be viewed in your browser:
