Description: Estimate district-level bounds for 2x2 ecological inference based on the approach 
    described in the forthcoming article Jiang et al. (2019), "Ecological Regression with Partial
    Identification", Political Analysis. Interval data regression is used to bound the 
    nonidentified regression parameter in a linear contextual effects model, from which 
    district-level bounds are derived. The approach here can be useful as a baseline of comparison
    for future work on ecological inference.
